# Computational-Physics-Research

This repository is a collection of my projects from Computional Physics at High Point University. The class was a project based class focused around modeling different physics topics, ranging from modeling particles in a box to simple modeling of Conway's Game of Life. Through the class, we had projects in four different topics and a final project which will be shown below. The goal of this repository is to show our work that we have done for others to see and be a resource for anyone who is doing work on something similar.

## Project List

#### Project 00: Displacement of a ball in a Plinko Board
The goal of the first project was to get an understanding of modeling with python in jupyter notebook and develop an understanding of how to explore a model and use it for research purposes. I decided to model a plinko board and explore if there is an average displacement that the ball had when being dropped from a random point and what effect kinetic energy loss had on that outcome.

#### Project 01: Modeling Rocket Motion
The purpose of this was to demostrate the use of ODE's to solve a system and graphing the findings of these simulations. My partner Timothy Beal and I decided the model the motion of a rocket using Euler's method. We investigated what effect the mass of the rocket had on both the velocity and momentum of the rocket.

#### Project 02: 
For this project, our assignment (Timothy Beal and I) was to demonstate that we could model realistic projectile motion taking both drag and the Magnus Effect into effect. Both being sub-par golfers, we decided to model a golf ball being hit and flying through the air. We used data from the Trackman Golf Simulator to get the launch angle, spinrate, and launch velocity to model a 3-iron through pitching wedge hitting a golf ball.

#### Project 03: 
This project was demonstrating the use of ODE's to simulate coupled oscillators. To demonstrate this we were tasked with finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the appropriate matrix and determine the frequencies and amplitudes of the normal modes. We visualized the normal modes with graphs and animating the model as it evolves. Our conditions for our oscillator was modeling 3 balls with a system with one free end and one end bound to a wall, and a system with both ends bounding to the wall.
