# Computational-Physics-Research

This repository is a collection of my projects from Computional Physics at High Point University. The class was a project based class focused around modeling different physics topics, ranging from modeling particles in a box to simple modeling of Conway's Game of Life. Through the class, we had projects in four different topics and a final project which will be shown below
