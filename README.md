# Computational-Physics-Research

This repository is a collection of my projects from Computional Physics at High Point University. The class was a project based class focused around modeling different physics topics, ranging from modeling particles in a box to simple modeling of Conway's Game of Life. Through the class, we had projects in four different topics and a final project which will be shown below

## Project List

#### Project 00: Displacement of a ball in a Plinko Board
The goal of the first project was to get an understanding of modeling with python in jupyter notebook and develop an understanding of how to explore a model and use it for research purposes. I decided to model a plinko board and explore if there is an average displacement that the ball had when being dropped from a random point and what effect kinetic energy loss had on that outcome.
